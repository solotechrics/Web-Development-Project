    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a passionate web enthusiast who enjoys building clean and simple
      websites using HTML and CSS. I love creating pages that are fast,
      responsive, and easy to navigate. My focus is on writing clear code and
      designing layouts that make information easy to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m currently learning more about frontend development and improving my
      design sense through small projects and real-world practice.
